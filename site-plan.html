        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Raleway</h4>
        <p>This font was formal yet stylish, giving professionalism for a lengthy read and being immediately pleasing
            for the swifter glance</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Proza Libre</h4>
        <p>This font was concise though slightly archaic in its demonstration. This is appealing both for audiences
            which are familiar with older text like Times New Roman, as well as that of new styles like Calibri</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
