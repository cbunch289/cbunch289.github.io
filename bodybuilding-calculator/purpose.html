            <h2>Grow Muscle</h2>
            <p>
                by training for growth. Training for impressive growth occurs with calculated effort. Muscles exhausted after
                8 to 12 consecutive repetitions will grow faster. As you work up to 3 sets of a given exercise you will
                fully
                tear all the muscle fibers and see significant growth with continuous use. Strength increases
                moderately.
                Endurance increases minimally, but overall appearance will develop far more effectively when these rules
                are applied.

            <h2>Increase Strength</h2>
            <p>
                by training for strength. Training for greater power occurs with calculated effort. Muscles exhausted
                after 3 to 5 consecutive repetitions will increase how heavy the load is being moved. As you work up to
                3 sets of a given exercise you will fully tear all the muscle fibers and see significant increase in
                strength with continuous use. Growth and overall appearance will develop moderately. Endurance increases
                minimally, but ability to handle massive loads will be much more achievable when these rules are
                applied.

            <h2>Improve Endurance</h2>
            <p>
                by training for endurance. Training to endure longer occurs with calculated effort. Muscles exhausted
                after 15 to 20 repetitions will withstand lengthier stress before needing rest. As you work up to 3 sets
                of a given exercise you will fully tear all the muscle fibers and see a dramatic improvement in duration
                and stamina. Endurance will improve. Growth will be minimal. Strength will increase minimally as well,
                but overall fitness will improve as well as ability to do consecutive rounds over frequent points of
                time.
