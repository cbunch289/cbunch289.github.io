        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>An interactive planning tool to achieve various exercise results</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This site is intended for exercise enthusiast, both beginners and experienced trainers alike. Primarily
            targeting beginners, the “purpose” page (as seen in the wireframes below) serves to lay out the three
            different major results of exercise and why certain modifications (increasing reps and sets) to the same
            type of exercise will yield those desired (and different) results. Young men and women training to join the
            military or to simply perform better in sports will benefit from using the Bodybuilding Calculator to format
            their daily workouts. Other trainers may already know how to achieve the desired results as found on the
            “purpose” page, but may struggle to transition from exercising with no weights to then using weights. The
            opposite is also true; individuals used to training with weights may find themselves up a wall without
            weights to keep up their routine. This is where the “equipment” page will layout the three basic categories
            of equipment options that most people have to choose from. The third page will be useful for both beginners
            and experienced trainers: “Muscle Groups.” “Muscle Groups” will continue to prove an enigma unless they are
            mastered and the only way to truly succeed in any field is to master the basics. Therefore, review of the
            muscle groups will make understanding of the equipment used and the result of exercise that much more
            rewarding for the committed athlete.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Roboto Condensed</h4>
        <p>This font was modern and concise. I'm expecting most of my readers to be accustomed to contemporary styles as
            that is what most bodybuilding articles tend to be written with.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto Condensed</h4>
        <p>I'm going to use the same font to avoid any distraction on my webpage being drawn away from the content of
            the text and not to the text itself.</p>
        <h4>Normal Paragraph Example</h4>
        <p>This calculator was built for both those just starting out, as well as those looking for new features to
            their routine. Try each combination to see what measures will yield your desired results.</p>
